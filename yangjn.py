# The current volume of a water reservoir (in cubic metres)

# The amount of rainfall from a storm (in cubic metres)
rainfall = 5e6
# decrease the rainfall variable by 10% to account for runoff
rainfall = rainfall*0.9

# decrease reservoir_volume by 5% to account for evaporation
reservoir_volume2=reservoir_volume1*0.95
# subtract 2.5e5 cubic metres from reservoir_volume to account for water
reservoir_volume3=reservoir_volume2-2.5e5
